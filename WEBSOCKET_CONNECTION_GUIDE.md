## ✅ What Was Implemented

We integrated **WebSocket support** into the SecurePool backend using the native `ws` package. This enables real-time bi-directional communication between the server and connected clients (e.g., Android app), useful for features like live game state updates, match notifications, or secure chat.

Specifically:
- Installed and configured the `ws` WebSocket server alongside Express.
- Established a WebSocket connection at server startup.
- Enabled client-side (app/emulator) testing with proper IP and port setup.
- Logged connection lifecycle events (connection, message, close, error).
- Verified data flow between frontend emulator and backend.

## 🛠️ Implementation Approaches

The WebSocket server was added with modular structure and live testing compatibility:

1. **Installed `ws` WebSocket package**
   ```bash
   npm install ws
   ```

2. **Updated `server.js`**
   - Imported required modules:
     ```js
     import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';
     import http from 'http';
     ```
   - Replaced the default `app.listen()` with an HTTP server:
     ```js
     const server = http.createServer(app);
     const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server });
     ```
   - Added basic connection handler:
     ```js
     wss.on('connection', (ws, req) => {
       console.log('WebSocket connected');
       ws.on('message', message => {
         console.log(`Received: ${message}`);
         ws.send('Ack: ' + message);
       });
       ws.on('close', () => console.log('WebSocket disconnected'));
     });
     ```

3. **Started backend with:**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. **Updated frontend client (or Android app) to connect:**
   ```js
   const ws = new WebSocket('ws://10.0.2.2:3000');
   ```

---

## 🧪 Testing Commands

### ✅ From Node or browser client:
```js
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000');
ws.onopen = () => ws.send('Hello server');
ws.onmessage = (msg) => console.log(msg.data);
```

### ✅ From terminal using `wscat`:
```bash
npx wscat -c ws://localhost:3000
```

---

## 📱 Testing from Android Emulator

1. **Ensure backend is running on host:**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Connect to backend using emulator’s IP:**
   ```js
   const socket = new WebSocket("ws://10.0.2.2:3000");
   socket.onopen = () => socket.send("Hello from emulator");
   ```

3. **Verify server logs:**
   ```bash
   WebSocket connected
   Received: Hello from emulator
   ```

4. **Watch for response:**
   App should receive `Ack: Hello from emulator`.
